### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love building things, tinkering with new tools, and learning new concepts. 

I find the process of dissecting a problem, analyzing the different components and evaluate possible solutions (with its trade-offs) extremely stimulating, especially when tackling complex, cross-functional problems with tangible outcomes.

Looking for new challenges within the data spectrum. Particularly interested in the intersection between data science and ecohydrology or freshwater issues.

Expertise in:
+ Programming and statistical analysis in Python, SQL
+ Usage of Git, GitHub, APIâ€™s
+ Data visualization and reporting
+ Geospatial analysis / GIS
+ Hydrology
+ Freshwater ecosystems
+ Lake management

Feel free to reach out to chat about data, freshwater ecosystems, Patagonia or just to say hi!
